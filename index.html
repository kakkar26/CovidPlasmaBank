        If you have fully recovered from COVID-19, you may be able to help patients currently fighting the infection by donating your plasma. Because you fought the infection, your plasma now contains COVID-19 antibodies. These antibodies provided one way for your immune system to fight the virus when you were sick, so your plasma may be able to be used to help others fight off the disease.READ ON!

        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">What is Convalescent Plasma?</span></h3><br>
        <br>
        Convalescent refers to anyone recovering from a disease. Plasma is the yellow, liquid part of blood that contains antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body in response to infections. Convalescent plasma from patients who have already recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contain antibodies against COVID-19. Giving this convalescent plasma to hospitalized people currently fighting COVID-19 may help them recover. FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to be used in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on scientific evidence available, the FDA concluded this product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">When can you donate?</span></h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        Donating while you are still battling the infection is not a good idea because you haven’t generated enough antibodies and the ones that you have will be needed by you to kill the virus. According to the FDA, the best time to donate is about 2 weeks after you have completely recovered from your COVID infection. To meet donor qualification, you need to produce evidence that you did indeed contract COVID. That means you will need your COVID positive test results.

        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Where can you donate?</span></h3>
        <br>
        <br>

        Major blood banks accept plasma donations. You can call their helpline numbers and enquire. You can also search plasma donation camps near your area on the internet. Whether you are a COVID survivor, or you have been vaccinated or none of the two, it is important that you continue to wear masks, maintain social distancing, go out only when necessary and sanitize frequently. The second wave is here and COVID is more infectious than before. Stay safe and get vaccinated when your turn comes.
