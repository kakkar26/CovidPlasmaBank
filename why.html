                <p>
                    Donating plasma can save lives. Your antibodies can help someone fight the infection and emerge victoriously. If your COVID symptoms have been absent for more than 14 days, kindly consider donating as a service to humanity.
                    
                    Just like during any regular blood donation session, blood will be drawn from your arm. It will be sent through special tubes that will separate the plasma from the blood.

               <h3>Does Plasma Therapy Cure COVID?</h3>
               <br>
               <p>Currently, it has shown positive results in Delhi and Mumbai where COVID cases are spiking high. It has also proven to improve the ability of a person to recover from the disease. However, there is more research required to prove its full efficacy in different patient types.</p>

                <h3>How Does Plasma Therapy Work?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A convalescent plasma therapy uses antibodies (a type of protein i.e produced by plasma) from patients who have completely recovered from COVID-19 infection. Here is how this procedure will fight coronavirus in your body.

                    Blood is taken from a previously infected but completely recovered patient, the plasma component of that blood is separated and that contains the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus. This plasma is injected into an infected personâ€™s body that will fight the virus and neutralise it from spreading.
                    Once the patient has recovered, he/she will be asked to donate their blood so that their antibodies will be used to treat other infected patients.
                    The blood sample will be checked for any existing harmful diseases such as Hepatitis B & C including HIV.
                    The recovered blood will be taken into study and a researcher will extract plasma from the blood that can be injected into an infected person.
